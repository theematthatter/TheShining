                Let's start off by saying that the most amazing thing about art is that no
                matter the intention of the artist, interpretation is completely subjective.
                The way that I might feel about this particular piece of art may differ from
                someone elses entirely. It's also what makes consuming art so much fun. Your
                experience might be different than mine. Having a dialogue about how it effeced
                you will make the next time I read it feel like a brand new book. Same goes for the film,
                which I plan on rewatching now that I have finished the book, seeing as how my
                first watch left much to be desired.

                The thing that I loved the most about this book, in comparison to the film,
                is the fact that Jack Torrance, for all of his faults, loves his family. He is
                taking this position at the Overlook Hotel in desperation to get his life back.
                He has been fighting demons within for so long, buried deep inside with the help
                of his father. His homelife showed him what having a family was supposed to be like,
                and it helped to create the blueprint he would use to dictate how he would
                treat his own family someday. However, in the back of his mind, he knows it's not right.

                After years of close calls with alcohol, and finally the unintentional breaking of his son's
                arm, Jack said enough was enough. He quit drinking and promised to do right
                by his family. Jack took the caretaker position at the prestigious Overlook Hotel, thanks
                to his old work colleague and drinking buddy. He was going to spend the winter staying sober
                and finishing his play. The problem was that, unbeknownst to him, the Overlook would become
                a blackhole that would consume ever bit of light that remained inside of him.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                This is the main issue that I had with the film. Jack was doomed the second he arrived
                at the Overlook in both the book and the movie, however, in the book, he actually had a
                fighting chance(again, I need to rewatch it to know for sure). His ambition for writing
                had returned, his play seemed to lay itself out right in front of him. Jack was being
                the attentive and affectionate husband and father that he never had. We got to see Jack
                at his best, before the Overlook began its slow and steady claim over his mind.

            <p class="para">
                This is where the book really shines (pun intended). Jack isn't just angry one day and
                decideds to kill his family. The take over happens bit by bit, and seeing it happen is
                what makes you really empathize with him. As someone who has quit drinking, I can understand
                what it's like to have a bad moment or a bad day and think <span style="font-style: italic;">
                    'god I could use a drink'</span>. Over time that feeling would begin to subside, but
                in an enviroment that is designed to break you down and have you submit to your worst desires
                and habits, you can see why he breaks. This also made his final scene with Danny so moving.

                The hotel has forced Jack to pin his son in a corner and bash his brains in with a
                hammer used in game that requires old rich people to knock a ball through a metal arch,
                similar to croquet. As jack raises the mallet over Danny's head, Jack's consciousness is able
                to break free from the hotels tight grip just long enough to save his son. He tells him
                to run, and to never forget how much he loves him, right before he turns the mallet on himself,
                bashing in his own face until only fragments of flesh and bone remain.
